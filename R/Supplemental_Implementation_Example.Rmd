# Introduction
Here, we demonstrate using some simple simulated data how meta-analyst's can implement some simple methods to correct for inflated Type I error rates when using multilevel models with non-independent effect size data. For ease of presentation, we use simulated data throughout and demonstrate two of the simplest and most effective methods that are most robust to a wide array of contexts that a meta-analyst might be faced with in analyzing their data.
