## Introduction
This repository houses the code and supplementary tutorial used to demonstrate how multi-level meta-analytic models from `metafor` can be corrected to avoid infated Type I error in the presence of non-independent effect sizes. The commentary is a response to Song et al. (2020), to show how a few simple corrections can provide some resolution to problems they identify in their very thorough simulations.

*Reproducing the simulations?* Users wanting to reproduce Song et al's (2020) simulations, along with the correlations implemented by us can find all the R code in tge `R/` directory.

*Just want to know how to apply corrections?* Users who are interested in learning more about how they can correct for non-independence can open and read the `Supplemental_Implementation_Example.html`
